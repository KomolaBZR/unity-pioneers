## Description:

**Target Audience:** The primary target audience for this game is children aged 4-12 years old.

**Game Concept:** Hunted and Hunter is a game where players can choose to be either a rabbit or a fox. As a rabbit, your goal is to run away from the fox, while as a fox, your objective is to catch the rabbit. Players must navigate through levels filled with obstacles such as stumps and stones and collect carrots (or fish) to gain speed boosts. The rabbit's ultimate aim is to reach the house at the end of the road (level), while the fox's goal is to catch the rabbit before it reaches the house.

**Development Stage:** This game is currently in prototype form with future development plans, including the addition of more levels, diverse environments, and complex game mechanics.
